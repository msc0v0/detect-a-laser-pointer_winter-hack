# Laser Pointer Detection

This project uses OpenCV to detect and track a red laser pointer in real-time using a webcam. It captures each frame, filters for a specified range of red colors in HSV space, and identifies contours matching the color of the laser pointer. When the laser pointer is detected, the program draws a green circle around it and displays its coordinates.

## Features
- Real-time red laser pointer detection
- Circle overlay and coordinate display on detected laser spots
- Adjustable HSV color range for tuning to different laser pointer colors

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Numpy library
